# Valadoc-app
This is a Desktop Application for the Valadoc website buiild with nativefier and electron-forge

To Build from source simply install electron forge on build system and run electron-forge make.

This repo contains releases for Ubuntu linux only (ElementaryOS and others built on Ubuntu also work fine).
It would be super easy to build for other platforms as electron-forge is super flexable with this
Theroretically this repo would eveolve into a place for all the builds but for now we off .debs to install :)
